# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Ansible Modules (Legacy)

## DEPRECATED

**The legacy OCI Ansible modules have been deprecated in favor of the new [OCI Ansible collection](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ansible-collection). These are no longer supported and there will be no further updates or fixes. Please migrate to the [OCI Ansible collection](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ansible-collection) for improved features and continued support. Refer to the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/oracle/oci-ansible-collections/blob/master/MigrationGuide.md) for best practices.**
